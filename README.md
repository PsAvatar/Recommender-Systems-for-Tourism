Recommender-Systems-for-Tourism
Our application aims to develop a recommender system for the tourism sector. A central element is the home page, where the user has the option to either create an account or log in to their existing account. After logging in, the user has access to a list of restaurants based on their ratings in order to make the best possible choice for their meal. In addition, an interactive map is provided below the restaurant list, which displays the exact location of all restaurants. Finally, there is a location filter that allows the user to select the desired location. This filter is created for testing purposes as the application is a prototype. In real life, users would log into their location via their mobile phone or computer, and the app would show them restaurants in their area.

for it to work you need to install all python 3 libraries

I would like it to be noted that the .env file I have uploaded contains the keys for the code to work and the api key of the map. it is for educational purposes
